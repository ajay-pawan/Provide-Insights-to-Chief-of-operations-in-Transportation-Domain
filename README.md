 Transpotation and Mobility Problem Statement

Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago, has gained a strong foothold in the Indian market by focusing on tier-2 cities. Unlike other cab service providers, Goodcabs is committed to supporting local drivers,
helping them make a sustainable living in their hometowns while ensuring excellent service to passengers. With operations in ten tier-2 cities across India, Goodcabs has set ambitious performance targets for 2024 to drive growth 
and improve passenger satisfaction. As part of this initiative, the Goodcabs management team aims to assess the company's performance across key metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, 
and the balance between new and repeat passengers.

## AD-HOC BUSINESS REQUESTS

**1.City-level fare and trip Summary Report**

Generate a report that displays the total trips, average fare per km, average fare per trip, and the percentage contribution of each city's trips to the overall trips. This report will help in assessing trip volume, pricing efficiency, and each city's contribution to the overall trip count.

**2.Monthly City_level Trips Target Performance Report**

Generate a report that displays the total trips, average fare per km, average fare per trip, and the percentage contribution of each city's trips to the overall trips. This report will help in assessing trip volume, pricing efficiency, and each city's contribution to the overall trip count.
If actual trips are greater than target trips, mark it as "Above Target".
 If actual trips are less than or equal to target trips, mark it as "Below Target".
Additionally, calculate the % difference between actual and target trips to quantify the performance gap.

**3.City-level Repeat Passenger trip frequency report**

Generate a report that shows the percentage distribution of repeat passengers by the number of trips they have taken in each city. Calculate the percentage of repeat passengers who took 2 trips, 3 trips, and so on, up to 10 trips.
Each column should represent a trip count category, displaying the percentage of repeat passengers who fall into that category out of the total repeat passengers for that city.
This report will help identify cities with high repeat trip frequency, which can indicate strong customer loyalty or frequent usage patterns.
